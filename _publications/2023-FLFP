excerpt: 'The participation of women in the labor force has increased significantly in recent decades, but it is still subject to persistent gender differences and social norms. One possible explanation for these differences is the influence of gender role attitudes, which refer to the beliefs and expectations about the roles and behaviors of men and women in society. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between female labor force participation and gender role attitudes, using data from a sample of women in South Korea. Our analysis shows that women participating in the labor force tend to have more progressive gender role attitudes, as measured by traditional and egalitarian scales. This effect is stronger for those employed full-time or in higher-status occupations, and it is moderated by education, age, and other demographic and socio-economic factors. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the complex and dynamic interplay between work and gender roles, and have implications for policies and interventions aimed at promoting gender equality and women's empowerment.'
