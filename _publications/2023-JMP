abstract: Abstract This paper addresses the underexplored question of conditional independence in financial econometrics by introducing a novel approach to estimate dynamic conditional partial correlations. Unlike traditional multivariate volatility models that predominantly focus on conditional correlations, this study employs a dynamic framework that utilizes precision matrices \mathbf{P}_{t}. The method integrates elements from Dynamic Conditional GARCH (DCC–GARCH) and Dynamic Correlation MSV (DC–MSV) models, and further enhances them by incorporating a Bayesian Nonparanormal approach for rank likelihood construction. The methodology is aiming to handle high-dimensional settings, employing a Metropolis-Hasting within Gibbs sampling algorithm for Bayesian estimation. The paper makes two primary contributions: First, it offers a nuanced measure for conditional dependence by focusing on conditional partial correlations rather than conditional correlations, thereby capturing intricate asset dependencies. Second, it introduces a computationally efficient Bayesian estimation procedure that deals with the challenges posed by high dimensionality.
