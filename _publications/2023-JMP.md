abstract: "This paper addresses a gap in the limitations of traditional multivariate volatility models in capturing complex conditional dependencies. To address this, we introduce a new perspective through a dynamic framework integrated with the Nonparanormal model for estimating dynamic conditional partial correlations. Unlike existing methodologies, our approach employs precision matrices and focuses on their temporal evolution, providing a more nuanced understanding of conditional independence among multiple assets. The
paper makes two contributions. Firstly, it presents a dynamic conditional framework that leverages precision matrices, achieved through Bayesian estimation methods incorporating elements from DCC-GARCH and DC-MSV models. Secondly, the paper handles high-dimensional settings through a coherent Bayesian estimation procedure, addressing the computational burdens associated with large datasets. A Monte Carlo simulation and empirical applications substantiate the methodâ€™s efficacy, particularly in settings with dynamic conditional correlations. The proposed methodology enhances the granularity of financial market analysis by providing a richer representation of conditional partial
correlations over time. This work connects the existing literature across high-dimensional multivariate volatility models, copula models, and Nonparanormal models."
