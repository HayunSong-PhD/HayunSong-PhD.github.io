abstract: This paper proposes a Bayesian approach for the estimation of large conditional precision matrices instead of inverting conditional covariance matrices estimated, using, for example, the dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) approach. By adopting a Wishart distribution and horseshoe priors within a DCCâ€“GARCH(1,1) model, our method imposes sparsity and circumvents the inversion of conditional covariance matrices. We also employ a nonparanormal method with rank transformation to allow for conditional dependence without estimating transformation functions to achieve Gaussianity. Monte Carlo simulations show that our approach is effective at estimating the conditional precision matrix, particularly when the number of variables (N) exceeds the number of observations (T). We investigate the utility of our proposed approach with two real-world applications. First, to study conditional partial correlations among international stock price indices. Second, to test for \boldsymbol{\alpha} in the context of CAPM and Fama-French 5 factor models with a conditional precision matrix-based Wald-type test. The results indicate stable conditional partial correlations through market disruptions. When there are market disruptions, blue chip stocks chosen from S&P 500 daily returns provide statistically significant evidence against the CAPM and Fama-French five models.
