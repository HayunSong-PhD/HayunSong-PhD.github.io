title: "Psychology   Evaluation   of   Fotonovela,   with  Aviroop  Ghosal"
excerpt: "Evaluated the effectiveness of a fotonovela, a type of comic book or graphic novel that originated in Latin America similar to a traditional comic book, but is illustrated with photographs rather than drawings, as an educational tool for teaching information about dementia compared to a standard brochure. Conducted regression analysis and found that the fotonovela had a significant positive impact on post-knowledge and follow-up-knowledge test scores for dementia with an increase of 3.467 and 7.980, respectively."
